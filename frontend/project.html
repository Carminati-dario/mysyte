                            CLEAR is a project born for the management of the
                            <strong>365LAC</strong> contracts. The main goal was
                            to automate a process that was previously done
                            manually, drastically reducing management time and
                            the risk of human errors. <br />
                            Developed entirely by me in 2025, the application is
                            a web-based solution.
                            <br />
                            It works by a <strong>web application</strong>. The
                            technology used is <strong>Go</strong> for the
                            backend and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the
                            frontend and styled with <strong>CSS</strong>.

                            <strong>The Prison Escape</strong> is a Korean logic
                            puzzle. The game consists of a grid in which you
                            must move blocks of different sizes to clear the
                            path and let the red block escape. <br />

                            The game was implemented using
                            <strong>HTML</strong> for structure,
                            <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity,
                            <strong>CSS</strong> for styling, and
                            <strong>React</strong> for building the user
                            interface. <br />

                        <p>
                            <strong>GoGroup</strong> is a school project focused
                            on the implementation of a TCP-based multi-chat
                            system using <strong>Go</strong>.
                            <br />

                            The main goal was to design a chat system capable of
                            handling multiple groups, where each user can join a
                            specific group and communicate only with its
                            members.
                            <br />

                            The system is composed of three main components:
                            <strong>Server</strong>, which manages
                            communication, groups, and message routing between
                            users; <strong>Client</strong>, which provides a
                            user interface allowing users to send messages,
                            choose or create groups, and set a username; and
                            <strong>Screen</strong>, which displays messages
                            received from the server. <br />
